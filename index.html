            <p>Hi! Welcome to my webpage. I worked in Information Technology for 15 years. A chance encounter with teaching
                    helped me discover my passion for it. I also love reading books. I am techie and am currently working with a few of my friends
                    on building a holistic STEM education for kids after school hours. I am also working on full stack
                    developer certification at UCIrvine extention to build th for my company. In my website you
                    will find links to some great reads and information on STEM based after school care. When I am not doing
                    something to do with technology, I learn Piano and dance. I teach sunday school and attend certificate
                    courses in East Indian Philosophy. My most favourite thing to do is enjoy outings with my 9 year old and
                    drive her around to her classes. I am in the process of working on my website so please stop by in a
                    few months to see some great updates.</p>
